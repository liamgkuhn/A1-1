Superball is a text based terminal app that loosely simulates soccer or ruby. The player’s objective is to get that ball from one side of the field to the other, or more accurately 50 meters from the halfway point where they started. The player can select from a number of predefined moves. The effectiveness of the player’s selected move is determined by where they are located on the field and the outcome of a random number generator. 

There are various memes, references and easter eggs sprinkled throughout the game for entertainment purposes...Are you not entertained!


To play Superball follow the prompts displayed on the terminal until tthe game’s completion. Goals or points are awarded for reaching position 100 and taken away if the app routs the player to position 0.
